# Step 7 – Documentation, Results Discussion, and Presentation Preparation

## 7.1 Thesis / Report Structure
Use the standard scientific thesis template (chapters as listed below) and integrate the outputs from Steps 1–6:

1. **Introduction**
   - Motivation for autonomous navigation.
   - Problem statement (summarised from Step 1).
   - Thesis contributions (e.g., custom Gym environment, PPO vs. A* benchmark suite, quantitative analysis).

2. **Literature Review**
   - Classical planners (A*, D*, RRT, hybrids) with citations (see Step 1 references).
   - RL-based navigation (DQN, PPO, sim-to-real).
   - Identified research gap and justification for the chosen comparison methodology.

3. **Methodology**
   - **Environment Design (Step 2):** map geometry, obstacle generation, observation and action spaces, reward shaping.
   - **Agent & Reward Design (Step 3):** full observation vector, discrete actions, reward formula (progress, safety, oscillation penalties).
   - **RL Model Development (Step 4):** PPO configuration (SB3), hyperparameters (policy network [128,128], `n_steps=4096`, `batch_size=1024`, learning rate `3e-4`, entropy coefficient `0.01`).
   - **Baseline Planners:** A* grid rasterisation, inflation logic, metrics.

4. **Experiments & Results (Step 5)**
   - Detail evaluation protocol: identical random seeds for PPO and A*, difficulty profiles, number of episodes.
   - Present primary metrics table (e.g., for hard difficulty, seed 123, 100 episodes):

     | Algorithm | Success Rate | Mean Path Length (px) | Mean Steps | Mean Reward | Mean Nodes Expanded |
     |-----------|--------------|-----------------------|------------|-------------|---------------------|
     | PPO       | 0.94         | 757.73                | 151.51     | 134.21      | –                   |
     | A*        | 1.00         | 775.12                | –          | –           | 582.76              |

   - Include CSV summary reference (`results/baselines.csv`) so values can be regenerated/updated.

5. **Visualisation & Analysis (Step 6)**
   - Figures to embed:
     - `results/figures/training_curve.png` (episode reward vs. timesteps with smoothing).
     - `results/figures/comparison_hard.png` (PPO vs. A* metrics).
     - `results/figures/trajectory_hard.png` (representative path).
   - Discuss qualitative observations (e.g., PPO takes slightly shorter paths but misses ~6 % cases; A* always succeeds but expands ~583 nodes).

6. **Conclusion & Future Work**
   - Summarise findings: PPO’s adaptability vs. A*’s determinism.
  - Future extensions: integrate RRT baseline, curriculum training, sim-to-real transfer, dynamic obstacles.

7. **Appendices**
   - Provide details on hyperparameters, training/evaluation scripts, reproducibility notes (command listings, environment setup).

## 7.2 Documentation Checklist
- [ ] Export the latest metrics table from `results/baselines.csv` into the report (LaTeX/Word table).
- [ ] Include generated figures (`training_curve.png`, `comparison_hard.png`, `trajectory_hard.png`) with captions explaining insights.
- [ ] Reference relevant code modules (e.g., `navigator/env.py`, `evaluate_rl.py`) in methodology sections.
- [ ] Ensure bibliography entries for the citations listed in Step 1 (Mnih 2015; Schulman 2017; etc.).
- [ ] Document reproducibility steps: Git repo structure, virtualenv activation, commands to regenerate metrics and plots.

## 7.3 Discussion Points for Results Section
1. **Performance trade-off:** A* achieves 100 % success but with longer mean paths and higher computational cost (nodes expanded). PPO achieves shorter average paths but occasionally fails in tight corridors (94 % success).
2. **Learning behaviour:** Training curve shows reward stabilisation after initial fluctuations; discuss the effect of reward shaping (progress vs. safety) on convergence.
3. **Qualitative behaviour:** Trajectory plots illustrate PPO’s smooth turns and corner handling; note failure cases (e.g., oscillation near narrow passages) if observed.
4. **Metric sensitivity:** Mention impact of resolution (A*) and sensor range/reward weights (PPO) on results.

## 7.4 Slide Deck Outline for Final Defense
1. **Title Slide:** Project title, student, supervisors.
2. **Motivation & Problem Statement:** Highlight navigation challenges and limitations of classical planners in dynamic/unknown maps.
3. **Literature Snapshot:** Two slides summarising classical planners vs. RL approaches.
4. **System Overview:** Diagram of the navigation pipeline (environment, PPO agent, evaluation suite).
5. **Environment & Reward Design:** Key parameters (map size, sensors, actions, reward components).
6. **Model Training:** PPO hyperparameters, training curve (embed `training_curve.png`).
7. **Comparison Methodology:** Explain shared seeds, metrics, evaluation scripts.
8. **Results:** Present main table and bar chart (`comparison_hard.png`).
9. **Qualitative Behaviour:** Include trajectory plot (`trajectory_hard.png`) and possibly a short video/gif (if recorded).
10. **Discussion:** Interpret success vs. path length trade-off; mention failure modes.
11. **Conclusion & Future Work:** Summarise contributions, propose next steps (RRT extension, dynamic obstacles, sim-to-real).
12. **Q&A:** Contact info, acknowledgements.

## 7.5 Deliverables Summary
- **Thesis Chapters:** Draft using the outline above; incorporate numeric results and figures from Steps 5–6.
- **Figures:** Generated PNGs stored in `results/figures/`; ensure they are referenced and captioned properly.
- **Data Tables:** Export from CSV to (LaTeX/Word) tables for the report; keep `results/baselines.csv` under version control.
- **Presentation Slides:** Build slide deck following the outline; embed key plots and bullet findings.
- **Supplementary Material:** Provide script usage instructions (README) and reproducibility notes in appendices.

With this plan, all prior steps (1–6) feed into the final thesis and defense presentation, satisfying Step 7 of the methodology.
